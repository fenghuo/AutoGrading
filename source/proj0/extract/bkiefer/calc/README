CS160 Project 0: Brynn Kiefer

I began with modifying the grammar for precedence and LL(1), which turned out to be a bit trickier than I originally thought. Changing it for precedence wasn't too hard, since I was able to base it off what we had done in class. But I had some trouble changing it to be LL(1), which I believe I achieved in the end, it just took longer than I thought it would to get it working. 

I then moved on to the scanner, which wasn't too difficult, just a bit tedious to recognized the multi-character terminals. I had a bug for a long time in the number scanning, which took me forever to debug, but, other than that, though, it was pretty straight foward.

I then started with the parser, which was more challenging than I thought it would be because of the way I originally set up my grammar. So, I had to go back and change my grammar a bit to make writting the parser easier. But, once I did that, the parser was pretty straight foward to write as well. 

I tried doing the error detection as I was writting the scanner and parser, but I don't know for sure if I managed to get it all working correctly in all the right places.

I then began with the C code output, which actually wasn't too bad after everything else was done. I finished everything except power, though I don't believe the if code is quite right with the goto statements.

Overall, the project wasn't too hard, once you had the correct grammar to work with. The most difficult part was modifying the grammar to make it easier to work with.
