I did the scanner and tested it, so that should work well. I developed my Grammar, made it LL(1) and stored it in calc_def.y, and it ran without any shift or reduce errors. My parser generates a parse tree with all correct output, and I believe it does this with the correct precendence. The program should also generate errors on time and correctly. The only part of the project I was not able to complete was the code generation portion, I had some trouble wrapping my head around the problem.
