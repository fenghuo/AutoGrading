To the best of my knowledge i have succesfully completed the following:

	Scanner
	Error Hanling
	LL(1) grammar
	Draw Parse Tree
	Recursive Decent Parser
	Error Handling
	Most of the c Code Generation

Issues:

	The issues i did not have time to solve involve the c code generation. There are several corner cases that i may not have tested. Also, exponentiation of anything other than integers does not format correctly.
