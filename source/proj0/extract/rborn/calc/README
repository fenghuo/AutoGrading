The scanner and parser both fully work.  They recognize all sentences in the language and produce a specific error with line number otherwise.  The grammar is unambigious and LL1.

There is no c code generation.  I was crunched for time with 3 other projects due around the same time and did not have time to develop the c code translation.  I plan on doing it later this week for my own good though.

The largest complication to begin with was mentally grasping the grammar well enough to design a well thought out parser.
