Oh gosh, I had one too many problems with this project. I started working on it on Saturday thinking that it would not take me up until rigth now to get it to work. I literally emailed Keith one too many times. Making my pow work for C took me forever to figure out. Hopefully everything works. I tested it to the best of my abilities.
