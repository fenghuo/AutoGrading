\f0\fs24 \cf0 I had a lot of trouble with this project. I wasn't sure how to format things and I got lost. People who I asked for help weren't getting very far either.\
\
Converting the grammar to LL(1):\
\cb1 \
There is ambiguity at Jump. It never goes to the second option: 
\f1\fs26 \cf2 "goto" number "if" 
\b Expression.\
\

\b0\fs24 It must be changed to Jump' with that second option.\
\
Also, for expression, it has to split up the Expression "+" Expression AND it does not follow PEMDAS. Power should be first, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction.\
