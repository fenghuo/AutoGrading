I did a lot o_O

No real problems.  Just a lot of tedious work.
It took me a very long time to debug some of the logic.

I basically started with a simple scanner that would read in 
input from standard input and spit out what kind of string it
encountered.  I was worried about white space separated operators.

I was having trouble handling outputing expressions out to stdout 
in the c program but I decided to use escaped to fprintf to stderr 
with embedded printf with embedded escaped characters. It was bad.

I'm worried I didn't handle divisions properly because they
generate floats but its all ints afterwards.

Outputting was a pain with char* so I refactored to use string
but that was another issue.  My biggest issue with this was the 
combination of using standard cstrings and char*.  The other
issue I was having was formating numbers properly or organizing
strings properly into the c statement.

Testing outputs was also hard because I had to capture both
the error stream and standard output.
