For this assignment, I initially started working on the scanner. The
scanner was very straight forward, and had no problems getting the 
stream and coverting to tokens. However, getting started on the project
took a little since having to deal with getting familiar with the existing
code.

Before I started the parser, I converted the grammar to LL(1) and then
started work on the parser. Both converting the grammar and creating
the parser was very straight forward. It was very interested to see how
the scanner and the parser interact interpret source files.

The hardest part in my opinion was generating the C code from the tokens.
Such things as the pow, if and print required storing the derivation
and then properly ordering everything.
