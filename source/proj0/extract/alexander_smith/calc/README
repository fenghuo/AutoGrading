I spent a lot of time on this project, mostly debugging. The scanner had a couple big issues that I wasn't able to solve for a long time, such as multi-digit numbers. The parser and grammar took awhile to figure out correctly, but were pretty straightforward. Getting C code to generate was weird.


**note: to compile the C code that is output, if it is using pow function, needs to have '-lm' arguments in gcc to properly link math**
