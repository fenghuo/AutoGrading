The scanner is written as a series of if else statements(probably the most silly way to write, im aware), very simple. It was tested from main( currently section commented out). Using the grammar we covered in class, and the rough draft given to us, I modified the grammer to include exponents, and made it LL(1). After that I wrote the parser using recursive descent, starting from the bottom(Factor), and working upward. It seemed easier to keep track of everything that way. Because the parser needs exponents and goto, there are temporary strings that keep track. –êfter that, the code generation. I recursively modified strings and appended to them. For goto and if, a slightly different procedure was used: I have a temporary string that I give to expressions. When I know what the expression is exactly, whether an if or a power happens, I modify around the temporary string, and then attach it to the string I pass back up the tree. The problems I had was the repetitiveness of writing everything, with just small details changed: it's very time consuming, and after a while, your head doesnt really think anymore, so mistakes and typos start to happen. Everything seems to work correctly.
