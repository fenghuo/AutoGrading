What is done:
     scanner 100%
     parser 100%
     errors 100%
What is partially done:
     C code

My scanner, parser, and errors are fully functional. For my C code(found in the input.c file), there are only two issues with it: any number with more than one digit is reading only the last digit, and the power function. Otherwise my code is functional. ~90-95% done.
