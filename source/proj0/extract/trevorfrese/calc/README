Here is the readme file.
I'm Trevor Frese. I did this project with my coding buddy Tai Rodrig. Our code will look similar as we pretty much designed the entire thing together while eating tortilla chips. We're roommates. 

Here's what we did :
1st we designed the parser. Tai had a shitty implementation so I implemented it using cin instead of getchar. 
Then we sat outside elings hall and drew out the entire grammar. It looked fine and we made sure it was LL1.
Then we implemented the parser. it was pretty easy. No errors on compile
The next giant hurdle were nums. we thought we had to have a separate queue for the nums and to release those individually but we ended up realizing that we could just have a private num variable and a public getter. that worked better and was more memory efficient.
last fucking huge hurdle was the goddamn fucking "power" operator.
we tried to use function pointers in C, tried to make functions for it, and then just ended up implementing a backtracking stack that carried the state of ** through the case statements.
i was really tired that day

overall cool project, learned a lot. you're a good teacher sherwood
